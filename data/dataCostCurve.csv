It is the largest redevelopment ever undertaken by CoM, with a stated value of $250mil (note: this appears to be excluding the purchase cost of the Munro site for $76mil in 2014, with the rest of the land transferred from the Crown subject to development milestones).The significant scope of the redevelopment project (across stages and parcels within the precinct) is best summarised in the (Draft) Master plan and Final Strategic Brief. Items identified include:  (i) Market renewal: various (ii) Franklin Street:  realign Franklin Street to New Franklin Street, (iii) Public space: conversion of the car park to a high quality public open space(iv) Queen's Corner: new building and various (v) Market events shed:  various (vi) Public realm improvements: upgrading of streetscapes (vii) Mixed use development:Sustainability considerations are described as ""In preparing this Draft Master Plan we are also considering the role that the precinct can play in building MelbourneÕs resilience.

The cost of the open space component (which has primary relevance to adaptation benefits) is unclear but is expected to be fairly minor component.It is noted that there will be significant economic and social benefits from this action. However from an adaptation perspective, these are largely business as usual (i.e. benefits that would occur regardless of a changing climate). Accordingly, there are expected to be adaptation benefits from:> Increased open space of 13,661 sqm (estimate from strategic brief).  This space is also expected to be permeable, and have natural shading (urban forest/canopy cover). This part of the redevelopment is scheduled for 'within 8 years' of the project start (2012).> Upgrading of streetscapes: assumed to be aligned to urban forestry targets for canopy and species diversity. Timing of these upgrades is unclear however assumed to be incremental over the project. Although not yet planned, there is possibility of water capture however it should be noted that a 600,000 litre storage tank was put into place in the area for use at the QVM in 2006.Plans for Solar PV on QVM roofs is also noted however these benefits are not considered to additional to adaptation.","Timing of costs is assumed to spread equally (pending more accurate information)Only adaptation costs and benefits associated with the open space areas are considered.In the absence of more detailed costing, an estimate of 20% of total cost is assumed for open space and streetscape areas (this will be  testing with CoM project owners).The benefits of open space (pervious surface) for flood impact reduction requires further analysis and/or modelling; however is not expected to be significant.

Data gathered from the survey regarding water efficiency measures are is unstructured (i.e. collected qualitative fields), meaning that it is difficult to accurately measure savings outcomes from the data currently being collected. ","The costs considered for this action are 'ongoing administrative' costs borne by CoM to maintain the program. The costs of program development and roll out (including administrative and financing  costs from the Sustainable Melbourne Fund) are not considered at this stage (note: to be discussed whether upstream cost should be included).Deloitte (in consultation with CoM in 2009) identified a successful 1200 buildings retrofit as one which achieves a minimum improvement in NABERS energy star rating either by 38 per cent or to 4.5 stars. They assessed the additional expenditure in modelled energy efficiency actions would be in the order of $0.8bn to $1.7bn (with an a median of $1.3bn all in real 2009 terms).  This equates to $1.083mil per building (i.e. $1.3bn / 1200 buildings) for all energy-related retrofit measures considered.An estimate of the annual energy cost savings per building is around $50,000 (based on a stated expected saving 383,000 tCO2-e p.a. across 1200 buildings,  a 1.33 tCO2-e per MWh Scope 2+3 electricity emissions factor in the modelled year of 2009, and a $200 per MWh commercial electricity price (in $2015 terms, and expected to rise over time). These 'back of the envelope' estimates suggest a simple payback of around 20 years, which supports the need for a financing arrangements under the program. No modelling was conducted by Deloitte for the costs or benefit of water efficiency. The uptake of alternative water storage (as an efficiency or savings measures) in targeted buildings is questionable (i.e. unlikely given the building footprint, usage and urban setting).  The Australian Government's  ""Water Efficiency Guide for Office and Public Buildings Guide"" (Dept of Environment and Heritage, 2006) suggests that the average water consumption for office buildings across Australia is 1.125 kL/m2 with best practice being 0.5 kL/m2. In Melbourne however, water efficiency is better than the national average (per NABERS benchmark star rating). Moving to best practice (around 4 star or 0.53 kL/m2) from a baseline of say, 2 stars (0.86 kL/m2) in Melbourne would result in efficiency gains of around 38%  (see Table 1 of the DEH guide).From an adaptation perspective, the benefits of the action are limited to:> energy savings: from HVAC measures result in the economic benefit to building owners for heat events due to reduced cooling loads. The effectiveness of HVAC measures in reducing heat in buildings (and health consequences) is not considered relevant as occupants in these buildings are not considered to be vulnerable (i.e. as existing HVAC in targeted buildings will operate in heat events.)> water efficiency: savings of water will reduce the demand for water in drought conditions.","The cost to CoM to administer the program has been assumed to be in the order of one FTE for one per year for administration, analyses and reporting (note: placeholder TBC). Challenges: attribution of retrofit measures to the program is difficult as the Wallis research data does not make a direct linkage between the program and outcomes. Quantification of the marginal (adaptation) benefit is difficult to model accurately as this dataset does not capture quantitative outputs of energy or water saved as a result of the program.Approach: aggregate modelling of the programs costs, benefit and uptake are used to provide a 'ballpark' estimate of the adaptation benefits (i.e. indicators used in the this model). The following assumptions and datasets are used:The proportion of costs for types of retrofit measures is not stated in the Deloitte report, but may be available in supporting modelling by Arup and Davis Langdon. Although costs and effectiveness for individual actions will differ, an aggregate approach for the 1200B Buildings business case (i.e. modelled actions to get to 4.5start NABERS) is assumed. The proportion of costs for HVAC  is based on the estimated that HVAC in office buildings makes up around 40% of total energy use (source: Industry.gov.au HVAC factsheet): this equates to $433,000 per building.Aggregate energy savings - additional to the business as usual case - are estimated to be around 26% (midpoint) by Deloitte (2009). This figure is used as a reasonable average for cooling load saving for the purpose of calculating adaptation benefit for heat conditions (i.e. with most if not all buildings assumed to be air conditioned). Only this % saving is provided by the Deloitte Report. Total energy use for all buildings is modelled as part of the modelling for  Indicator #3 at 15.30 GWh per day.  The scope of 1200 buildings is estimated to account for two thirds of all commercial buildings in the City of Melbourne (see 1200 Buildings factsheet). This equates to an average energy use per targeted building of 8.5MWh per day (= 15,000 MWh per day x 2 / 3 / 1200 buildings). Cost of water saving retrofits is assumed to be relatively minor. Water savings are based on estimates of net lettable floor area across the targeted commercial buildings (i.e. two thirds of the CoM total provided by City Research).Uptake is assumed according to the S-curve (sigmoid) projected by Deloitte (to be refined with actual uptake estimates)",0,0,0,2,0,2
